# Welcome to Kevin Kuc's GitHub Profile! 👋 👋 👋

## 📚 About Me
I'm Kevin Kuc, with a Master's in Data Science from UC Berkeley and a strong foundation in mechanical engineering, I merge deep technical expertise with impactful data-driven solutions. During my graduate studies, I engineered advanced machine learning algorithms for diverse applications, notably healthcare and finance. Key projects include designing a predictive model for hospital readmissions among diabetic patients and developing a risk assessment tool for loan defaults at LendingClub. My professional experience spans leading-edge work in AI and data science, including optimizing CNN-based models for real-time aircraft classification and deploying Python-based deep learning applications for the Space Development Agency (SDA). I am proficient in Python, SQL, React, and cloud services like AWS and GCP. Passionate about leveraging machine learning and software development to drive innovation, I’m eager to collaborate and deliver solutions that matter.

## Projects
### 🚀 NeuralRunner - Portfolio Website

NeuralRunner is my portfolio website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It serves as a showcase of my projects, skills, and experience in the field of data science and engineering.

### 📊 Loan Status Prediction with Machine Learning

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict loan status based on various features provided by Lending Club, a peer-to-peer lending company. The model classifies whether a loan will be fully paid or charged off.

### 🌎 LLA to ECEF conversion Project
The lla_ecef_coding_challenge script is a Python tool designed for calculating and interpolating Earth-Centered, Earth-Fixed (ECEF) velocities based on latitude, longitude, altitude (LLA) data provided in a CSV file. It offers functions to convert LLA coordinates to ECEF coordinates and compute velocities at specified target times. This tool is essential for geospatial applications requiring accurate positioning and velocity information.
