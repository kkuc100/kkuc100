# Welcome to Kevin Kuc's GitHub Profile! 👋

## About Me
I'm Kevin Kuc, a passionate data scientist with a background in mechanical engineering and experience in military intelligence. I'm currently pursuing a Master's degree in Data Science at the University of California, Berkeley. My diverse background has equipped me with a unique skill set that combines technical expertise with leadership and problem-solving abilities.

## Projects
### NeuralRunner - Portfolio Website

NeuralRunner is my portfolio website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It serves as a showcase of my projects, skills, and experience in the field of data science and engineering.

### Loan Status Prediction with Machine Learning

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict loan status based on various features provided by Lending Club, a peer-to-peer lending company. The model classifies whether a loan will be fully paid or charged off.

### Manufacturing Engineering
