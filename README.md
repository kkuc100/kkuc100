# Welcome to Kevin Kuc's GitHub Profile! 👋

## About Me
I'm Kevin Kuc, a passionate data scientist with a background in mechanical engineering and experience in military intelligence. I'm currently pursuing a Master's degree in Data Science at the University of California, Berkeley. My diverse background has equipped me with a unique skill set that combines technical expertise with leadership and problem-solving abilities.

## Projects
### NeuralRunner - Portfolio Website

NeuralRunner is my portfolio website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It serves as a showcase of my projects, skills, and experience in the field of data science and engineering.

### Loan Status Prediction with Machine Learning

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict loan status based on various features provided by Lending Club, a peer-to-peer lending company. The model classifies whether a loan will be fully paid or charged off.

### LLA to ECEF conversion Project
The lla_ecef_coding_challenge script is a Python tool designed for calculating and interpolating Earth-Centered, Earth-Fixed (ECEF) velocities based on latitude, longitude, altitude (LLA) data provided in a CSV file. It offers functions to convert LLA coordinates to ECEF coordinates and compute velocities at specified target times. This tool is essential for geospatial applications requiring accurate positioning and velocity information.
